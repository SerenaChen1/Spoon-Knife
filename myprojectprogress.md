Project Progress

As I mentioned in the last lab, I saw a Reddit post that expressed interest in a RateMyProfessor for the landlords in Troy, so I was thinking of making an open source version of that application.

For this project, I would like to follow the blessed repository workflow. I used this method in Software Documentation and Development last semester and found that it worked really well. My teammates and I were able to work simultaneously on our own portions of the project, and we were able to avoid a lot of merge conflicts.
